## About
- Chuck is a bot developed by Pika.py, a bot developer, in the [Pycord](https://discord.gg/pycord) library, which is a fork of the official [Discord.py](https://discord.gg/dpy) library in Python!
- Chuck was developed in order to make moderation a lot easier, and also let people have loads of fun, without leaving Discord.
- Chuck is as of now in v2.4.3 and will migrate to slash commands and buttons in v3.0.0.
- We hope to add a lot more features to the bot in the upcoming future!
- Stay safe!
- The prefix is **c!**
